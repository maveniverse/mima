# MIMA Maven Model Reader (MMR)

MIMA extension to load Maven models (raw or effective) with resolving them. This extension does NOT build
Maven projects, nor produces Model "as a project being built"! For that use Maven.

Use this extension to load effective POM/Models of _deployed_ (resolvable) artifacts.
